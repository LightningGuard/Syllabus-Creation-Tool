"# Syllabus-Creation-Tool - Visual update" - Destin Krepps
For  iteration 3 ive focused on creating an easy way to navigate the site with more clean and modernized visuals to do this
i worked on learning html and css styling along side building logos and such in photoshop to give our site personality
alongside moving our email security leaks into a spot where it was not vulnerable which allows us to use our email system
without worry of abuse. Lastly i collaborated with a teammate to implement said email notification system i put into place
last iteration into their previously completed web app to show more possible application within our site.


Running the project:
    1) Clone the project
    2) Switch to the dev branch and pull
    3) Download the .env from Discord and save it to the project root directory (where you git cloned)
    4) If not using pycharm, create a venv and switch to it

  Run in a terminal:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

    once done to access the web page navigate in a browser
    to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    and then this iteration you can use the navbar to make your way around the site

Testing the project:
    1) Download as above (if haven't already.)
    2) Download chromedriver 9.5 unzip and store in core (we already have it there if not)

   In a terminal:
    1) python -m pip install selenium
    2) python manage.py test

    this will go through our old tests and doing so will also test what i worked on this iteration with looks and the email
    within the syllabus creator app

    1)a test opening and entering valid input for name,email,and inquiry then clicking submit
    2)a test opening and not entering anything in the text fields then clicking submit (this will reload and show all three fields shows errors telling user to fill in all fields)
    3)a test opening the site and entering an invalid email address then clicking submit (this will show the user that they have messed up that field and must enter a valid address)
    4)tests that test syllabus creators fields and show that the email system is not failing

    these tests are sufficient in showing off new look in different sizes of the browser window and that with all the
    stylistic updating the visuals dont interrupt previously completed things and that the email is working in syllabus
    creator.
