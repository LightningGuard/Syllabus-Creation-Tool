"# Syllabus-Creation-Tool"

Syllabus creation tool is a new tool for professors to engage their students to look at their syllabi. Professors will be able to post their syllabi into our database to be stored where students can access them through a drop down menu. The website will offer students to be able to select their current classes which will then take all the important dates and plot them on a calendar. The website will also offer a visual breakdown of the courseâ€™s grading policy. Syllabus creation tool will allow the users to be able to create accounts. Which will be a student and professor account with different permissions. Overall, this is a new tool so that students will actually look at the course syllabi since usually most students do not and this will provide students with information that they will care about.
