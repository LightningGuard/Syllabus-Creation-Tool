    Student Academic Integrity :
</div>

</br>

<div class="indent_syllabus1">
    By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly
community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty.
Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong.
Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.
To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the Academic Integrity Resources for Students page,
the Faculty Handbook (Sections 14.2-14.3), or for graduate courses, the <a href="https://gradschool.umbc.edu/" style="color: yellow">Graduate School </a> website.
