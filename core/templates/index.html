<h3>A Tool for Displaying and Tracking Syllabi.</h3>
<p>Syllabus creation tool is a new tool for professors to engage their students to look at<br>
    their syllabi. Professors will be able to post their syllabi into our database to be <br>
    stored where students can access them through a drop down menu. The website will offer <br>
    students to be able to select their current classes which will then take all the important dates <br>
    and plot them on a calendar. The website will also offer a visual breakdown of the courseâ€™s grading policy. <br>
    Syllabus creation tool will allow the users to be able to create accounts. Which will be a student and <br>
    professor account with different permissions. Overall, this is a new tool so that students will actually<br>
    look at the course syllabi since usually most students do not and this will provide them with information <br>
    that they will care about.</p>
